Feedling is a Windows-based RSS reader that sits handily on your desktop. It's a .NET 3.5 WPF app that's been tested on XP, Vista and 7 (both x86 and x64), and should work on 2000 as well. I find it useful, even if no-one else does. It might well work on other architectures, under Mono. I've not tested this at all and it will probably break horribly. Besides, there's probably much better solutions on those architectures anyway.
